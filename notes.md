- `ciw`
    - I remember seeing something that "iw" is a text object
    - `c` does something specific -> `i` would normally enter insert mode, but it doesn't here...
- To view a key sequence mapping,
    - For default mappings, use `:h {bind}`
    - For custom mappings, use `:map {bind}?`
- Select parentheses-, brace-, or bracket-wrapped string
    - Enter visual mode on openning/closing character, (`(`, `{`, `[`) <!-- comment to fix parenteheses matching -- ) -->
    - Use `%` to move cursor to matching character.
    - Full sequence is `v%d` to delete entire 
- `gg=G` to reindent entire
